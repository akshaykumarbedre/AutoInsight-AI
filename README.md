# 🚀 AutoInsight AI

> **Conversational Analytics + AutoML Agent + RAG Intelligence**  
> A full-stack AI agent platform for natural language data analysis and automated machine learning — built to demonstrate real-world engineering and data science excellence.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**AutoInsight AI** enables both non-technical and technical users to interact with real-time databases and build machine learning pipelines using only natural language.  
It combines:

- 🧠 **AI Agents** (NL to SQL, AutoML, Charting)
- 📊 **Auto Dashboards**
- 🧪 **End-to-End ML Pipelines**
- 📚 **RAG-powered Explanations**
- 🧑‍💼 Dual UI for both business users and ML engineers
