Summary of the Data Analysis and Model Training:

1. **Initial Data Overview**:
   - The dataset `cost_2025-07-08_2025-08-07 (1).csv` contains 31 entries and 10 columns.
   - Many columns had significant numbers of null values, particularly in fields related to monetary amounts and organization details.

2. **Data Cleaning Process**:
   - Missing values were addressed by filling:
       - Numeric fields with mean values.
       - Categorical fields with mode values.
   - Rows containing null values in critical columns (`start_time` and `end_time`) were dropped.

3. **Model Development**:
   - After cleaning, a linear regression model was developed to predict the `amount_value` based on `start_time` and `end_time`.
   - The model was successfully trained using available data.

4. **Model Output**:
   - The trained model was saved as `linear_model.pkl`.

This summary encapsulates the steps taken during the data analysis process and the model training, providing a clear record of the methods employed and outcomes achieved.
